# Experimental Features
I am hopping to roll out a section that allows mod developers to try out Experimental Features, like the ones you will see listed below

## How to enable any Experimental Feature
In Developer Engine, go to Mod Info and go to "Experimental Features" and there will be listed the Experimental Features

# Global Currency
Basically users will be able to get Tokens / Coins / Currency that is unnamed right now and can be implemented directly into your mod.
ex: I play Double Kill on Vs Impostor port and get 400 beans, and I opt-in for currency.
It will add that currency is global for all mods, Your Mod can disable global currency if need be, but also gaining currency will effect all mods.

# This list will be updated with more dumbass features that probably make no sense.
