# GameJolt Mod Intergration
There is a way to do anything.
Having GameJolt Intergration would be cool for the fact of achivements and easy mod upload.

# GitHub Auto-Update
This im hoping we do add, you will be able to auto-push updates to your mod though GitHub.
I also mentioned it [here](https://github.com/ItsLJcool/YoshiCrafterEngine-LJ-Optimized/blob/main/cool%20things%20I%20wanna%20do.md#5-github-compatible)

# Mod List
Built in the engine that shows all the mods that are uploaded to the Internet that are compatible with YCE-Opt
This will work with GameJolt / GitHub.

# Documentation
In the Modded-Engine version, pressing a shortcut button will allow you to open up a substate of the documentation directly in-engine
(Detachable probably) [Mentioned Here too](https://github.com/ItsLJcool/YoshiCrafterEngine-LJ-Optimized/blob/main/cool%20things%20I%20wanna%20do.md#1-documentation-directly-implemented-into-the-engine)

# Mod Rating
In relation to the Mod List, you can rate Mods in-engine and people can see the rating on it.
(eh idk)

# User Profiles
All of your YCE-opt will be displayed under your User Profile.
You can link your YouTube, Twitter, Discord Server, and GitHub accounts with your User Profile.
