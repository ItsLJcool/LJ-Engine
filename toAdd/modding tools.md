# Modding Tools:
### Character Editor
### Dialogue Editor
### Mod Info (Editor)
### Song Editor / Song Maker (Easier if its condensed)
### Stage Editor
### Week Editor
### Script Editor (Might scrap)
Basically this is the default like "Cutscene" and Script addon to the .json but more easier to read and stuff.

# alr here come the wierd ideas from LJ
### Modchart Editor
NOW BEFORE you go yelling at me, I am hoping this can settle the "oh modchart editor bad!!" since there is a good way of doing this
I might take inspiration from other Editors but basically make editing / creating cool modcharts easier instead of coding all of it.

It will contain:
1. Moving Note Strums
 - Normal Notes can be moved / set to other Strums like how Hotline 024, Indie Cross, etc do it.
2. Adding More Strums
 - An example is Indie Cross with 3 Strum lines, Hypno's Lullaby, etc.
3. Adding / removing Multiple Keys
 - Transposing from 4k to 5k or 4k to 8k.
 - Also might do an advanced thing where if you switch between different keys, instead of 4k to 5k and the farthest right note doesn't have any notes and you have to rechart, might automatically do it for you, if you want it done
4. Scripts will work directly with Modchart Editor to also give you more freedom.
