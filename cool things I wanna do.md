# Here is some things I wanna add to the Optimized YCE:
## 1. Documentation Directly implemented into the Engine
Instead of opening a new Google tab, we can have a Tab you can press like Log Overlay and search directly in-engine.

## 2. Modding Support vs User Engine.
Basically you can download 2 different engines
### Modding Engine
Where you have access to all the Modding Tools like Toolbox, Developer Mode, etc.
### User Engine
Where all Modding Debug is ripped and all your able to do in engine is like your playing regular modded FNF

This is used to get rid of bloat but also for accessability.

## 3. Insane Crash Handler (Might not do since suck at coding !!)
In-game crash handler that directs you to the Line, .hx, and if its a Script or Engine Issue
This will be in both engines and could also do a thing where it sends the Data to a server if you have a bot in your Discord Server

ex: Script.hx has an <eof> error, and you didn't catch it before exporting to .ycemod, and when users are playing it and Script.hx is used, it will send a
ping (can be disabled) and if there is multiple people sending errors it wont bloat the Channel, just increment the number by editing.

## 4. Making .ycemod, well not just a Zip File
If you didn't know already, any **.ycemod** is just a **Zip in disguise.** So naturally your code can be seen instanly.

It would be cool to obscure your code, but also just as a feature if you want it to not be obscrue.
This would only be for exporting as you wont be able to get back the original data once exported.

So, github cool

## 5. GitHub compatible
You would be able to link your GitHub to automatically update your mod by releasing a .ycemod file and flagging as release and it will auto-update.
***Users aren't forced tho.***

If you use a Beta tag, users will be notified that a Beta is out and will not override the normal Mod, but add a Beta folder into the orignal mod and can be deleted if it bloats your Mods Folder (since it will literally be a new download of every asset, If I made code that re-uses assets from the OG mod, im sure it would get messy)

## 6. Network Support?
prob not, but an idea.

## Make Moddifying the engine, hopefully easier
if not then oops.
