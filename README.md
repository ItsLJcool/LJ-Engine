~~YoshiCrafterEngine-LJ-Optimized~~
# LJ Engine (Placeholder Name)

We have switched plans for this engine, Instead of making it YoshiCrafterEngine Optimized, its now its
own engine, We plan on crediting YCE for inspiring us to make a better version of itself and make its legacy live on... but really, YCE has to go. Since the debut of YCE, Yoshman29 set out to make a really good engine that takes what we know as FNF mods, and bring it to a next level.

## What will this Engine be exactly?
I'm not sure, but Yoshman29 inspired me to continue FNF modding, and now that he is officially leaving the FNF community, I would like to continue something he didn't want to.

This engine will take what YCE gave to modders, and add upon it, maybe even adding more. The [toAdd](https://github.com/ItsLJcool/LJ-Engine/tree/main/toAdd) folder will be used for features we plan on adding, suggestions we make public (and my crazy ideas lmao) to stand out for FNF Engines.

## Why not continue as "YCE-Opt"?
For starters, YCE is terrably coded. Even Yoshi admits that, thats also why he wanted to make "Codename Engine". To let YCE die and to improve his mistakes. I was so into how YCE functioned that I basically know 90% of that mess of code (ex: Where code is located and how it functions, etc) and figured out cool stuff you can do with Softcoding.

If we continued YCE's legacy, that means we are defined by things Yoshi put, examples are the UI, how things are coded, Mod Supports, etc.

With an engine that is its own allows us to fully expand the idea of **"make a really good engine that takes FNF mods to the next level".**

# How will the engine look like (in terms of visuals and modding support)?
Completely different.
This engine we are planning on making everything customizable, but also allowing New Modders to use assets that they probably wont have access anywhere else.

For Starters;
- TitleState
- MainMenuState
- FreeplayState
- Options
- "Medals"
- StoryMenuState
- Toolbox
will have a unique UI (i think its GUI not sure) and look nothing like Base game.

We are not afraid of changing things, since most FNF Engines will try to make the game feel simular to Base FNF. To make this more of a Moddable Engine, that means redoing a lot of things. **Even making the ENTIRE PROJECT FROM SCRATCH!**

But **DO NOT WORRY,** all of those states will be customizable though Hscript (The Softcoding Language).
And if feedback is enough, we can have a togglable Base FNF States for your mod(s) [THIS MAY NOT BE ADDED]

# Community Feedback
The last thing we want is an engine that updates and gets no Modders, and gets phased out entirely...
So, ofc we love Community Feedback. Even though people can't agree to everything, there always is a middle point we can reach.

Experimental Features will be a thing in this Engine, until we can be sure the features we add are stable. This goes hand to hand with Community Feedback, as we can change features before it gets fully intergrated with the Engine.

This GitHub Repo should be public to make a Fork and help us work on some features, not everyone will be merged with Main branch but it does help this engine stay active.

# [Last Thing] Engine Name + Features
The Engine name is unknown, so for now call it **"LJ Engine"**.
This is ***NOT*** the final name, and you can suggest a name in the Discord server at the bottom of the README.md.

Features I hope the engine will recieve (functonally working) within its lifetime:
1. Modding / User Tutorial
    - this will help everyone get acustomed with the engine. Since not everyone has an IQ of 300.
2. Custom Logging / Error Handling without game crash
3. User Profiles
4. Custom Mod Dowload Page Intergrated with the Engine
    - Goes with **User Profiles**, instead of going on skechy websites (like MediaFire with no reason in particular), you can just launch the engine, open up the Mods Page, and download ~~Sonic.exe 3.0 Restoration all softcoded that runs at 3fps because the people making the mod behind the scenes are just people who want attention~~ Good FNF Mods within seconds, all without downloading a Zip thats 20gb, realizing its a Mod, and not sourced modded, then installing the engine thats half working. üòê
5. *Highly doubt btw* | Online FNF.
6. Replayability on Mods and the Engine.
    - Like an Economy System.

Anyways, enough rambling. Thanks for Reading this far. Go get a Cookie or smth.
