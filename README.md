# How to help on YCE Optimized:
Currently, helping on a project that has nothing in it won't help but in the future basically you would
fork this Repo and making changes on your own github, then **[requesting a push / pull request here](https://github.com/ItsLJcool/YoshiCrafterEngine-LJ-Optimized/pulls)**

Thanks to the YCE Community for everything
