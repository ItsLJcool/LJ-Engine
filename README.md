# YoshiCrafterEngine-LJ-Optimized

This is going to be a whole Re-do of YoshiCrafterEngine, engine and hopefully optimize it better. Help is appreciated.

# What is YCE-Opt?

YCE-Opt (or YCO? idk) is going to be more of a Re-write + Optimization of the Popular YoshiCrafterEngine, than just a "New Engine".

Codename Engine is supposed to be better than YCE, it might be, but the way he started CNE, didn't sit right with others. (Personally I didn't care, as long as it was better than YCE, CNE would be a decent Engine).

Allegedly CNE performs **Worse** than Psych Engine in some cases, and at that point it drew some lines for some people.
Yoshi no longer works on CNE due to "Controversy" about things I don't pay attention to so idk what happened.

This Engine is going to try to innovate upon its predecessor Engine, and improve how Engines will work in the future

# How to help on YCE Optimized:

Currently, helping on a project that has nothing in it won't help but in the future basically you would
fork this Repo and making changes on your own github, then **[requesting a push / pull request here](https://github.com/ItsLJcool/YoshiCrafterEngine-LJ-Optimized/pulls)**
  
# How to help right now

If you want to help, then DM me on Discord (ItsLJcool#7560) and show me some coding you have done on FNF mods.

If you don't know how to code but still want to help, then suggest some things you might think will fit this
YCE-Opt (I guess we are calling it YCO? but I like YCE-Opt).

Thanks to the YCE Community for everything
