Sorry I didn't want to do this, but right now somethings ive tried to hide from my friends (mostly) but some dont know what is going on in my life

Right now my mom has called the police on me in an attempt to get me to go back to her house (I live with seperated parents)

All you need to know is that she isn't giving back items that SHE doesn't own to ME, and even though im 16, By court order she can't take things away she didn't pay for.
She also can't take away my phone from me, Im allowed to have it from 8:00am to 8:00pm, at the time when I requested the phone it was ~4:00pm.

I said, "Give me my stuff back or im going to my dads"
She said go ahead. She gave the go ahead.

I am at my dads house and she comes to my door and tells me to come back. I said, "Ok well can I have my stuff back then?"
"No you cant! (ItsLJcool), after not going to bed untill 2:30am on Friday, and saying up late Sunday you cant have your stuff back"

Again, court orders she cant deny that request

She has now "called the cops" on me. that was 20m ago they havent showed up yet.
If I am unable to be on from today and the next 2 weeks, or suddently dissapeared. You know why (somewhat) but also in Arizona the cops are basically "curropted" (SORRY VOID FOR SPELLING MISTAKE) and this could be the last of me right now

If I do come back I will give updates and explan 12 years of My Horrible life to anyone that asks if you want more info.

Im sorry it came this way, Keep Funkin' Friends
